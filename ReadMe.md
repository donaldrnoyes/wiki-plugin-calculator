# Federated Wiki (experimental) - Calculator Plugin

*This federated wiki plugin is part of an experimental code refactoring, which is very much a work in progress. See [WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki) (ruby), or [WardCunningham/wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/wiki) (node), for the current stable versions.*

This calculator showed the feasibility of numerical calculations expressed in an alternate markup. Its derived from an earlier awk script now in coffeescript.
